                <p>These studies reveal that effective workplace learning and effective supervision are deeply intertwined. Supervisors don't just manage production—they shape the conditions that enable or constrain how their crews learn, develop, and stay safe.</p>

            <div class="takeaway-content">
                <p class="takeaway-text">For the mining industry to advance safe production, it needs a <em>systems-wide approach</em> to learning—one that recognises learning is continuous and socially constructed, promotes on-the-job development supported by qualified mentors, and prepares supervisors for the full complexity of their role.</p>
                <p class="takeaway-subtext">Current training focuses narrowly on technical competence. But effective supervision requires "passion, style, and smarts"—capabilities that supervisors themselves say are insufficiently addressed in their training.</p>
